# Case Study: Remodeling Data Using PostgreSQL Hosted on Amazon RDS

In this case study, I will remodel data from the popular **Sakila** dataset. The dataset will first be **denormalized** to simulate a real-world messy data scenario, and then **normalized** again to demonstrate data modeling techniques.

I'm using the **AWS Free Tier** of Amazon RDS with **PostgreSQL**, without Multi-AZ deployment. The database is managed and accessed using **pgAdmin 4**, installed locally on my private workstation.

To ensure secure access, I have configured **inbound rules** in the associated **Security Group** to only allow traffic from my **office IP address**. This minimizes the exposure of the database to unauthorized access.

> *Inbound rule setup in AWS allowing access to port 5432 (PostgreSQL) only from a specific IP address.*


## 1. Populating the Database with Data

To populate the database, I use the Sakila dataset available on GitHub:

![SQL scripts in GitHub repo](https://github.com/KamilKozera/cs-data-modeling/blob/main/png-files/file_2.png)


Since **Amazon RDS** does not grant superuser privileges, certain SQL commands like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE language DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;
ALTER TABLE language ENABLE TRIGGER ALL;
```

must be removed. This means all data inserts must be performed with full integrity checks enabled.

## 2. Creating denormalized data model.

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Denormalized Table</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4">
        <img src="https://github.com/KamilKozera/cs-data-modeling/blob/main/png-files/file_3.png" alt="Denormalized Table Image" width="300">
      </td>
      <td>
        Using the SQL script found 
        <a href="https://github.com/KamilKozera/cs-data-modeling/blob/main/sql-scripts/denormalize-scripts/denormalize.sql">here</a>,
        a single, denormalized table named <code>denormalized_table</code> was constructed. To accelerate the creation of this complex, intentionally flawed starting point, a Generative AI was leveraged to produce the baseline script. Specifically, it contains the following known issues that we will resolve:
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1NF Violation:</strong> The <code>actors_list</code> and <code>special_features</code> columns contain non-atomic, multi-valued data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>2NF Violation:</strong> With a composite primary key of (<code>inventory_id</code>, <code>customer_id</code>, <code>rental_date</code>), columns like <code>film_title</code> (dependent only on <code>inventory_id</code>) and <code>customer_first_name</code> (dependent only on <code>customer_id</code>) represent partial dependencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>3NF Violation:</strong> The table contains transitive dependencies, such as <code>customer_country</code> being dependent on the non-key attribute <code>customer_city</code>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
