# Case Study: Remodeling Data Using PostgreSQL Hosted on Amazon RDS

In this case study, I will remodel data from the popular **Sakila** dataset. The dataset will first be **denormalized** to simulate a real-world messy data scenario, and then **normalized** again to demonstrate data modeling techniques.

I'm using the **AWS Free Tier** of Amazon RDS with **PostgreSQL**, without Multi-AZ deployment. The database is managed and accessed using **pgAdmin 4**, installed locally on my private workstation.

To ensure secure access, I have configured **inbound rules** in the associated **Security Group** to only allow traffic from my **office IP address**. This minimizes the exposure of the database to unauthorized access.

## 1. Populating the Database with Data

To populate the database, I use the Sakila dataset available on GitHub:

![SQL scripts in GitHub repo](https://github.com/KamilKozera/cs-data-modeling/blob/main/png-files/file_2.png)


Since **Amazon RDS** does not grant superuser privileges, certain SQL commands like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE language DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;
ALTER TABLE language ENABLE TRIGGER ALL;
```

must be removed. This means all data inserts must be performed with full integrity checks enabled.
